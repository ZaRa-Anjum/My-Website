        <p>My favorite hooby is cooking, I have made many delicious foods of different cusines. Italian,Lebanese,Indian and Chinese.Whenever i find an interseting recipe i start collecting the ingredients for it and cook it the next day. My most successful and most tasty dish I ever made is the mango tart, the base of the tart is a biscuit base and the inside is a creamy mango filling with some chooped dryfruits and cherries for garnish. There is another dish which I absolutely love the most which is Croissants. The types of Croissants I made where filled with chocolate almond ganache. </p>
